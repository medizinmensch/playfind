## What is playfind?

A small web-app to guide friends to your favourite spotify-playlists.

### How do I use it?

You can try it immediately on yseichter.de/playfind !


### How do I fork it?

If you want to add your own custom music-paths including questions, answers and final playlists you only have to edit the database "musicfy_real.json" (and build and host it on your own).
